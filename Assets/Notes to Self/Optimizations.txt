--Codes that Requires Optimization--

	BulletDmg Script:
	- Probably better to use switch statements when checking for bullet modifiers such as pierce and elements


--Systems that need to be implemented another way--
	
	Damage Numbers:
	-Should play different dmg animation for different type of dmg done
		-Normal dmg, Crit dmg, Explode dmg, etc. Should each have their own animation
		-Normal dmg - small
		-Crit dmg - large, screen shake, diff color
		-Explode dmg - medium, screen shake, diff color
