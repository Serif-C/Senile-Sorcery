Some ideas to make the game an immersive adventure experience:
- Make money/coin (basically loot from monsters) feel important
	- drop rates could be low
	- prices could be expensive
	- money/coin could be used in a lot of things
	- etc...

- Make some sort of invisible progression system that a player would naturally do
	For example:
	- Complete several runs to earn Account Levels and progress the skill tree
	- Make the next floor significantly harder than the previous floor to encourage grinding
	- Grind for monster drops to afford gears, enchantments, potions, cards, etc... 
	- Complete achivements to unlock features (eg, better items, etc...)
